These General Conditions apply to proposals, offers and/or invoices issued by The Company, as well as to all agreements concluded between The Company and the Customer in the context of the Platform. \n\nAny deviations from these General Conditions are only opposable to The Company subject to the explicit, prior and written acceptance by The Company.\n\n1.3. If a Customer purchases a Subscription to the Platform of The Company, this means that they fully and unreservedly agree to these General Conditions.\n\nARTICLE 2 – NATURE OF THE SERVICES\n\n2.1 The Platform consists of two parts.\n\nThe first part, called “premium zone”, gives Customers access to all the Content regarding analyses around sport events that The Company itself makes.\n\nThe second part, called “masterclass zone”, gives Customers access to all the Content regarding the sports betting industry. \n\nThe Company own insights are shared via, amongst others, videos and via an instant messaging technology on which different type of sports betting related content is shared that The Company itself takes.\n\n2.2 The Company does not provide advice on financial planning within the meaning of the Act of 25 April 2014 on the status and supervision of credit institutions and stock exchange companies and therefore does not fall within the scope of this latter Act.\n\nARTICLE 3 – FORMATION AND ELEMENTS OF THE CONTRACT\n\n3.1. All proposals and/or offers made by The Company are non-binding, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n3.2. In order to purchase a Subscription and thus make use of the Platform, the Customer must be 18 years or older. \n\nThe Customer declares to be 18 years or older by registering to the services of The Company.\n\nThe Company cannot be held liable if the Customer turns out not to be of legal age.\n\nIf the laws of the country, state or province where Users reside require a higher minimum of age, they acknowledge and agree that they must be of that minimum age in order to set up and account and make use of the Platform.\n\nThe Company may ask for additional age or identity verification at all times.\n\n3.3. To purchase a Subscription and thus place an order, the Customer must follow the ordering process as set out on the application of the Platform.\n\nThe Customer must fill in his/her customer details and choose a payment method, whereby the Customer can use a promotional code if available. \n\nIn the next step, an overview of the desired order is displayed in detail. It is the Customer’s responsibility to verify the order and, if necessary, to correct any input errors before placing the final order.\n\nThe Company hereby reserves the right to ask for any additional information if necessary.\n\nBy fulfilling the ordering process, the Customer places a binding order for the Subscription and undertakes to pay for it. After the Customer has placed the order, \n\nThe Company will immediately confirm the order to the Customer by e-mail.\n\n3.4. The Customer subscribing to the Platform via the applicaiton of The Company agrees that the service will be provided immediately after purchase, and that Subscription to the Platform will commence as soon as the purchase process (as described in section 3.3.) is completed. \n\nPursuant to Article VI.53, 13° of the Economic Law Code (“CEL”), the right of withdrawal for consumers provided for in Articles VI.47-VI.53 CEL does not apply.\n\n\nARTICLE 4 – PRICE AND PAYMENT\n\n4.1. The price of a Subscription depends on the package the Customer chooses. The Company offers the following packages:\n\n• SILVER PACKAGE: This Subscription grants the Subscriber access to the premium zone for a duration of twelve (12) months, commencing from the date of the completion of the Subscription ordering process.\n\nIt is expressly understood that this subscription is intrinsically linked to the ATP Tennis Calendar season, as published annually. \n\nConsequently, it is acknowledged that during the month of December each year, no predictions can be provided, given the absence of scheduled events during this period. \n\nThe month of December is an integral part of this subscription, and the lack of predictions during this month shall not constitute grounds for extending or renewing the subscription beyond its original term. \n\nThe price for the SILVER PACKAGE is €397.\n\n• GOLD PACKAGE: This Subscription provides access to the masterclass zone for an undetermined period and twelve (12) months access from the date of completion of the ordering process of the Subscription. \n\nIt is expressly understood that this subscription is intrinsically linked to the ATP Tennis Calendar season, as published annually. \n\nConsequently, it is acknowledged that during the month of December each year, no predictions can be provided, given the absence of scheduled events during this period. \n\nThe month of December is an integral part of this subscription, and the lack of predictions during this month shall not constitute grounds for extending or renewing the subscription beyond its original term. \n\nThe price for the GOLD PACKAGE is €997.\n\nAccording to Schedule 2, Section 3.8(b) of Apple’s Paid Applications Agreement, we are required to disclose the name of our auto-renewing subscriptions, their lengths, and the corresponding prices. \n\nAs such, we have included this information for both the SILVER PACKAGE and GOLD PACKAGE subscriptions as follows:\n\nSILVER PACKAGE: Twelve (12) Month Subscription - Price: €397\nGOLD PACKAGE: Twelve (12) Month Subscription - Price: €997\n\n4.2. The price for each Subscription package is the price as mentioned on the website of the Platform on date of the purchase of the Subscription. \n\nThe prices for the Subscription are the total prices to be paid.\n\n4.3. The Company reserves the right to change the prices for a Subscription at all times. \n\nUnless otherwise indicated by The Company, a change of price will have no effect on current Subscriptions which are ongoing at the time of change.\n\n4.4.

In the event that the Platform is not accessible for a period exceeding one (1) week due to demonstrable force majeure, the Customer is entitled to an extension of their subscription for the period during which the Platform was not accessible. \n\nDemonstrable force majeure never leads to a refund of paid Subscriptions.\n\n9.5. If the force majeure lasts longer than one (1) month, the Customer shall be entitled to unsubscribe without court intervention and without The Company being liable to refund or pay any compensation to the Customer.\n\n\nARTICLE 9 – TERMINATION\n\n10.1.
